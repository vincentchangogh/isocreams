Isocreams is an isochrone fitter. It features a module that can be used to input data 
files containing various absolute magnitudes, and obtain a graph containing isochrones 
from the relevant filters. 

For the purposes of this exercise, we are using absolute magnitudes in the B and V bands. 

Under the folder isochrone_fitter, we have a module containing functions that can be used 
to load a stellar library, which will then load the isochrones, and then plot them.
